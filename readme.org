* QA-edit

A web based UI to search for papers, browse parsed pdf documents, edit a SQuAD
like QA dataset.

** functionalities

FastAPI backend to handle the dataset GET/POST methods:
- load a sample (by id)
- save sample (update)

Automatically:
- load latest json file
- save json file automatically after update

** UI elements

Luckily for us html and the browser will implement many of features for us (i.e. text wrapping, text
highlighting, etc.). Which should technically make all this work much easier.

- id (input) + next/prev (buttons)
- label (combobox)
- topic (combobox)
- question (input)
- answer (input)
- context_id (combo)
- context (text area)
- passage + ref (readonly text area or paragraph)
